01-Oct-19,OIR-FOI-2019-0085,Other,"Under Freedom of Information, please assist me with a request. My request relates to the yearly expenses claimed by Members who only served as a Deputy for part of the year 2017. I am seeking information about the expenses claimed and the attendance records (which are used to determine expenses) of some of the Deputies who were appointed as Ministers. For the Members who served as Deputies until they were appointed as Ministers on 20/06/2017: Brendan Griffin / Ciaran Cannon / John Paul Phelan / Jim Daly / Kevin 'Boxer' Moran / I would like to receive: 1. Confirmation of the amount in expenses claimed by each of these Members for the year 2017, and any correspondence discussing the amount to be paid or materials used to verify these expense claims. If these records contain personal information, then please redact this information only. If these records are too cumbersome to produce, then please confirm the amount in expenses only. 2.  The second part of my request is for something I believe you hold as a record already. I would like a record of the attendance days for the period 01/01/2017 to 30/06/2017 for these Members. I can not find this on the Oireachtas website, in the Reports published as 'Deputies Verification of Attendance for the Payment of TAA', where all the other records exist. All of the above Members were Deputies up until their appointments as Ministers on 20/6/2017, so I would expect their attendance records to date till June. However, the attendance records on the website have no entries for these Members for most of 2017. The latest I could find for them is on the sheet: 'Deputies Attendance January 2017 Verification of Attendance for the Payment of Travel and Accommodation Allowance (Jan 2017)' (Published on 1 Mar 2017). I would expect the record to continue until June but as far as I could see, the full attendance records for these Members have not been published, as they are for all other Deputies.The end of year Record of Attendance for 2017 has no record of any dates for these Members (even though this is supposed to be the ""completely verified"" attendance record for all Deputies) so I think they may have been left off by mistake. I am curious because the rules say that expenses will be paid based on pro rata attendance if Deputies do not serve for a full year, but in the absence of proper attendance records I can't see how expenses are decided. Given that the Oireachtas routinely publishes information related to Records of Attendance for the purposes of TAA allowances for Deputies, and it looks like the information I am seeking has not be published by mistake, I am hoping this record will be straightforward to produce. 3. Other than what is published on the Oireachtas website, are there any current Guides related to Salary and Allowances for TDs and Senators? If so, I would like to have copies of these, specifically can I have any such record published or issued in the lifetimes of the current Dail/Senate.By guides I mean a) circulars b) memoranda etc that were issued (but not actually published on-line) and that advise TD/Senators about the rules for claiming allowances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
